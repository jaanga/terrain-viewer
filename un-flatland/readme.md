* Currently r10 is the latest. The code hs been split into two files: a mapmaking file and a menu or user interface making file.
The map-making file is fully functional. It can be embedded with a minmimal HTL wrapper in an iframe. It supports numerous permalink parameters.
Pleasingly, the file size is under 300 lines of code. 
* Embed in HTML: [Embedded map demo]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain-viewer/un-flatland/gallery10/un-flatland-embed-demo.html )  
	* This demo shows the unflatland JavaScript being embedded in a normal HTML web page. 
	* Permaninkls are used to set location, altitude, camera and locations and more. 
* Comprehensive application demo [FGx Plane Spotter - latest]( http://jaanga.github.io/fgx-plane-spotter/latest/index.html )

<!--
_2014-02-20 ~ Please note that all current activity is happening in this fork of unFlatland: 
**[FGx Plane Spotter]( http://jaanga.github.io/fgx-plane-spotter/index.html )**.
This fork is under heavy development. New features are baing added every day.
All new features in FGx Plane Spotter will be added to unFlatland and work will resume here when things calm down.
Your comments and suggesions are welcome._ 
-->

[unFlatland r5.1]( http://jaanga.github.io/terrain-viewer/un-flatland/r5/un-flatland-r5.html )

* Version with lights and shadows. These features will make their way back into the latest revision


For [Leap Motion]( https://www.leapmotion.com/ ) device enabled and earlier versions see: [Flying Leap 3D]( https://github.com/jaanga/gestification/tree/gh-pages/projects/flying-leap-3d )


## Concept

### Mission
To supply the fastest, smallest, sweetest 3D map code you ever saw.

Currently there are three streams - all in various stages of development.

* unFlatland ~ a generic 3D map
* FGx Plane Spotter ~ a map application for flight simulation
* A Leap Motion device enabled version

### Vision

Maps that change the world.

## Features

* Covers every part of the world that Jaanga Terrain covers - sames as [OSM]( http://www.openstreetmap.org/ ) covers - matches [Slippy Map]( http://wiki.openstreetmap.org/wiki/Slippy_Map )
* Works in your browser  - no plugin required
* Runs files locally or sourced from a static file server - such as [GitHub Pages]( http://pages.github.com/ )
* Carries out all the interpolation necessary to view zoom levels 8 and higher
* Supports real-time zoom, pan and rotate
* Creates and reads permalinks for zoom, latitude, longitude, vertical scale and map type and more
* Toggle 3D placards that show place names, elevation and other data
* Toggle display of menu and stats
* Easy to build your own place lists
* Supports large user-defined gazetteer
* Supports many 2D map overlays
* Provides a variety of navigation aides
* Generic 3D library - can be used with other apps and libraries
* FOSS, built with less than 500 lines of code
* Very small file size ~ you can easily open up and start hacking
* Fast enough to be usable. Displays Frames per second


## Road Map

* Fast, accurate way to go from XYZ to lat/ln/alt. Opposite of getPoint.
* Add shade and shadows
* Add fog
* Reset view altitide with each redraw
* Double click to zoom in to indicated location
* Given lat/lon, find appropriate alt for camera and target
* <s>Place cameras at designated locations</s> 2014-03-04 ~ Sdded
* Toggle between two types of camera controllers: first person or trackball
* Add skybox? Add fog?
* <s>load four 128 x 128 meshes</s> 
* Add diagonal navigation buttons
* <s>Add and remove adjacent 3D tiles as needed</s>
* Display adjacent tiles in 2D
* Can we get this down to 30 metre detail?  


## Issues and Bugs

2014-03-05 ~ Placard not display properly when permalink set


2014-01-28  

If you go to some high altitude location such as Mount Everest or Machu Pichu - and see nothing - the map may be above you and you will need to drag it into view. 
This is a Jaanga Terrain issue. 

Vertical scale is is set quite high by default. This is to help provide a game-like experience. Feel free to change the scale.

## System Requirements

The code on this site makes extensive use of the latest and most demanding Internet technologies - including HTML 5 and WebGL and HTML.

In order to view the files or run the apps on this web site you will need a device and browser that provides good support for [WebGL](http://get.webgl.org/).
WebGL is the JavaScript API for rendering interactive 3D graphics and 2D graphics within any compatible web browser without the use of plug-ins. 

Hardware: Generally WebGL support requires a computer with an Intel Core i5 processor or better with an external GPU such as one made by Nvidia or AMD. 
Successful use of the apps on a phone or tablet is highly unlikely. A computer that is good for heavy gaming is a likely to be satisfactory.
A mouse or other pointing device with a scroll wheel is also highly recommended so that you can zoom, pant and rotate in 3D.

Browser Support: The apps here are currently being and tested with the Google Chrome browser.
Bugs on browsers other than Chrome need not be reported until such as the work settles down and an effort to support more browsers is initiated.

_2014-02-21 ~ 2014-03-03 ~ continuous progress. too muvh to update_ 

2014-02-20 ~ Theo

* Update menus and read me

2014-02-20 ~ Theo

* Update menu and read me files

2014-01-30 ~ Theo

* Added toggle display of place name placards
* Addle toggle display of menu and stats

2014-01-29 ~ Theo

* Read me updated, iframe added

Fixed or dealt with:  
The current big issue is that - often but not always - nothing happens wnen you change the zoom, scale, overlay, latitude or longitude  
Workaround: Change city location - just about always causes an update

From R4 and before:

* <s>~~Works only in Chrome~~</s> fixed
* <s>~~Dropdown list items only update when you change city~~</s> fixed
* <s>~~First person controller: Mouse actions only work when initiated from top of screen. Should work from anywhere.~~</s> Fixed
* <s>~~Trackball controller: after you return from first person controller drop downs no longer work. Must reload page to make changes.~~</s> Fixed stupidly: reload page
* Elevation drops to naught on one side
* Go to lat/long then change scale: goes to previous location
